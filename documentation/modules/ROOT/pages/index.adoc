== Introduction

The aim of this laboratory is to take you through the complete lifecycle of a Helm Chart named *base-chart* using Ansible Automation Platform. This Helm Chart will help operation teams on daily tasks like:

* Managing applications deployments.
* Control resources.
* Security and policies.
* Cluster housekeeping.
* Environments and cloud services management.

The laboratory focus in the lifecycle of the *base-chart*:

. Operations team make a change in *base-chart* repository (ex: new feature).
. Previous change triggers a workflow in Ansible Automation Platform.
. The workflow execute a set of job templates to:
.. Setup testing environment in OpenShift.
.. Deploy a testing application using the *base-chart*.
.. Validate a scenario.
.. Clean up environment in OpenShift.
.. Package and upload the *base-chart* new version to Nexus.
.. Send a notification with the new version if everything works as expected.
. Development teams will update the version of the chart in their application resources (repositories that ArgoCD is using to deploy applications).
. ArgoCD will automatically perform the deployment into OpenShift using the new chart.

The lab is divided into two blocks of sections. The first one, from section 1 to 5 is a set of guided exercises that will allow you to familiarize yourself with the environment and create the foundation of the Helm Chart lifecycle . 

The last one is a section called *Challenges*, a set of exercises with no guide that will allow you to face more real scenarios in your own way.

IMPORTANT: If you have any questions or concerns please let us know, *we're more than happy to help!!*
