:!sectids:

== Introduction

The aim of this laboratory is to take you through the complete lifecycle of a Helm Chart named 'base-chart' using Ansible Automation Platform. This Helm Chart will help operation teams on daily tasks like:

* Managing applications deployments
* Control resources
* Security and policies
* Cluster housekeeping
* Environments and cloud services

The lab is divided into two blocks of sections. The first one, from section 1 to 5 is a set of guided exercises that will allow you to familiarize yourself with the environment. The last one is a section called 'Challenges', a set of exercises with no guide that will allow you to face more real scenarios in your own way.

IMPORTANT: If you have any question or concern please let us know, we're more than happy to help!!
