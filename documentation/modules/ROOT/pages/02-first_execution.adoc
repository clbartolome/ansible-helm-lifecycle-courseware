[#webhook]
== Configure Webhook

We have created a Helm Chart named *base-chart* that will help Operation Teams with cluster management and also will help Application Teams with application deployments. In order to make upgrades or fix issues in our *base-chart* we are going to create a pipeline that manages the Helm Chart lifecycle.

The first step is creating a webhook in our *AAP Workflow* (pipeline) and configure it in *Gitea base-chart* repository so we can trigger it when new features or fixes are commited in our repository.

=== Create Webhook in AAP

* Login into *Ansible Automation Platform* and go to: *Resources* > *Templates* > *[WF] Base Chart Pipeline* and click *edit*.
* Enable the option *Enable Webhook*.
* Under *Webhook details* select *GitHub* as *Webhook Service*.
* Click *Save* to generate the *Webhook Key*.

NOTE: Copy the *Webhook Key* and the *Webhook URL*.

=== Configure Webhook in Gitea

* Login into *Gitea* and open *base-chart* repository.
* Go to *Settings* (top right corner) > *Webhook* > *Add Webhook* > *Gitea*.

image::2-first-whgit.png[]

* Configure the following fields:
** *Target URL*: Copy the *Webhook URL* from AAP.
** *Secret*: Copy the *Webhook Key* from AAP.
** Keep the rest of settings by default.
* Click *Add Webhook*.

[#nexus]
== Configure Nexus Package Playbook

Nexus is going to be the repository where we're going to upload our packaged *base-chart*. In order to be able to upload it automatically as part of our pipeline, we need to modify the playbook where the chart is packaged and uploaded to point to your student repository in Nexus.

* Login into *Gitea* and open *helm-ansible-pipeline* repository.
* Open the playbook *05-helm-package-nexus.yml*.
* Replace all content with this:

[.console-input]
[source,yml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]

- name: Helm Package Nexus
  hosts: all

[#chart]
== Update Chart Repository

Now it is time to trigger our *AAP Workflow*. To do so we're going to make a change in our *base-chart* repository and that change will automatically trigger the pipeline.

* Login into *Gitea* and open *base-chart* repository.
* Open the file *chart/Chart.yaml*.
* Modify *version* to *1.0.0*.

* Click *Commit Changes*.


[#validate]
== Validate Execution

Pipeline should be now running in *AAP* and the new version of *base-chart* should be in your student repository in Nexus, let's take a look at it.

* Login into *Ansible Automation Platform* and go to: *Views* > *Jobs* > *[WF] Base Chart Pipeline* (last execution):

image::2-first-aap-wf.png[]

* Access the *Workflow* to review the execution, all *JobTemplates* should have a green check:

image::2-first-wf-view.png[]

Now let's login into *Nexus* > *Browse* > *%USER%* to validate that the new version of your *base-chart* has been uploaded.

[#app]
== Update Application

Currently your *demo-app* deployment in *ArgoCD* is pointing to an initial version named *base-chart-0.0.1*. In order to update it and use the new version that we've just created, we need to update the deployment files in *ArgoCD*.

* Login into *Gitea* and open *demo-app* repository.
* Open the file *deploy/Chart.yaml* and update:
** Repository: change */helm* with your student id.
** Version: update to *1.0.0*:

[.console-input]
[source,yml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]

apiVersion: v2
name: demo-app
description: Demo App
type: application
version: 1.0
appVersion: "1.0.0"
dependencies:
- name: base-chart
  repository: http://nexus.app-lifecycle-lab.svc:8081/repository/%USER%/
  version: 1.0.0
----	

* Commit your changes.

* Login into *ArgoCD* and open your *demo-app* application. *ArgoCD* automatically syncs each 3 minutes but we can manually force *ArgoCD* synchronization by pressing the *REFRESH* button (use the default synchronization values). Now you should see your changes applied in the section *LAST SYNC RESULT*.

* Login into OpenShift and go to *Topology* and select your *%USER%-demo-app* namespace.
* Open your *deployment* clicking on the *NGINX* icon:

* Click on *demo-app-xxx* pod link to review pod details and validate the pod have a label *helm.sh/chart:base-chart-1.0.0*:

image::2-first-pod-labels.png[]

NOTE: Review the other labels added by the *base-chart* to help on cluster housekeeping tasks.

* Use the *URL* button in OpenShift topology view to open your application, the chart version should be *base-chart-1.0.0*:
