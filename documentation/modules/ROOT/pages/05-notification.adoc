= Notifications

If everything worked as expected it is time to notify other teams so they can update their deployments and take advantage of the new features or fixed errors.

In this laboratory we're going to use *Slack*. 

WARNING: Visit *User Configuration section* to configure your username if you haven't set it up yet!

TIP: Take a look at *3. Testing Environment* > *Run Workflow Manually* to review how to test the Workflow manually.

[#config]
== User Configuration

As part of this laboratory setup there should be a credential already configured in *AAP* > *Resources* > *Credentials* > *Slack Token*.

image::5-not-creds.png[]

This credential is exposing the following environment variables in the job template *[JT] Notify New Release*:

* Slack token: SLACK_TOKEN
* Slack channel: SLACK_CHANNEL

IMPORTANT: All user will be using the same Slack channel (*#rhte-lab*) and token so please do not modify these values.


[#task]
== Send Notification

In this section we're going to configure the last task or playbook so we send a notification with some basic information.

Of course that information could be extended with other information like a git release link, description of the changes, jira tickets, nexus url, aap url,...

The first thing we have to do is save the new chart version as a variable so we can read it in the *notify-new-release* task.

Steps::	
+	
--	
* Go to *Gitea* and open *helm-ansible-pipeline* repository.
* Open the playbook *05-helm-package-nexus.yml* and edit it.
* Add a new task to store the chart version as a variable named *new_version*.
* Commit your changes.

TIP: Use the collection *https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/set_stats_module.html[ansible.builtin.set_stats]* to create the variable.

TIP: To get the chart version take a look at a task named *Load Chart information* in that same playbook.

Solution::

* Go to *Gitea* and open *helm-ansible-pipeline* repository.
* Open the playbook *05-helm-package-nexus.yml* and edit it.
* Add a new task to store the chart version as a variable named *new_version*:

- name: "Populate New Base Chart version {{ version }}"
  ansible.builtin.set_stats:
    data:
      new_version: "{{ version }}"

The playbook should look like this:

- name: Helm Package Nexus
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: false

  tasks:
    - name: Debug

        msg: Helm Package

    - name: Clone Base Chart remote repository
      ansible.builtin.git:
        repo: http://gitea.app-lifecycle-lab.svc:3000/%USER%/base-chart.git
        dest: /tmp/base-chart
        version: master

    - name: Package Helm test scenario
      ansible.builtin.shell: helm package chart
      args:
        chdir: /tmp/base-chart

    - name: Load Chart information
      ansible.builtin.include_vars:
        file: /tmp/base-chart/chart/Chart.yaml

    - name: Nexus Credentials
      ansible.builtin.set_fact:
        nexus_credentials: "%USER%:%USER%"

    - name: Upload Helm Base Chart package to Nexus
      ansible.builtin.shell: |
        curl -X 'POST' \
        'http://{{ nexus_credentials }}@nexus.app-lifecycle-lab.svc:8081/service/rest/v1/components?repository=%USER%' \
        -H 'accept: application/json' \
        -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
        -F 'helm.asset=@base-chart-{{ version }}.tgz;type=application/gzip'
      args:
        chdir: /tmp/base-chart

    - name: "Populate New Base Chart version {{ version }}"
      ansible.builtin.set_stats:
        data:
          new_version: "{{ version }}"

* Commit your changes.

Now that the *new version* is saved as a variable in our Workflow we can send a notification on each new release.

[tabs, subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
====	
Steps::	
+	
--	
* Go to *Gitea* and open *helm-ansible-pipeline* repository.
* Open the playbook *06-notify-new-release.yml* and edit it.
* Add a new task to send a notification to *Slack* with:
** token: "{{ lookup('env','SLACK_TOKEN') }}".
** msg:  the value of the variable *new_version* and your *username*.
** channel: "{{ lookup('env','SLACK_CHANNEL') }}".
** Configure the rest as you consider.
* Commit your changes.

TIP: Use the collection *https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/general/slack_module.html[community.general.slack]* to send the notification.
