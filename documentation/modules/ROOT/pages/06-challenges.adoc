= Challenges 

First of all, *CONGRATULATIONS %USER%* for getting to this point of the Lab!! 

You should already have a good understanding of what we are trying to achieve and therefore it is time for us to get closer to what our *base-chart's lifecycle* would look like in real scenarios.

We would like to propose a series of challenges that we consider important for the management of the base-chart. In any case, if you want to continue in another way, perfect! But please keep us informed so we can learn too!

[#validations]
== Aditional Validations

We've included some validations in previous sections but there are more resources managed by the *base-chart* that we should validate:

. Labels.
. Deployment:
.. Strategy.
.. Ports.
.. Liveness and readiness probes.
.. Environment variables.
.. Volumes.
. Service.
. Route:
.. Host.
.. TLS configuration.
. ConfigMap.
. Secret.

TIP: Take a look at the *Multiple Scenarios* challenge to simplify the testing of all the resources.

[#scenarios]
== Multiple Scenarios

Currently as part of the *base-chart* pipeline we're just installing one scenario. The idea would be to install different scenarios at the same time and perform validations on parallel.

This is an example diagram of how the pipeline could look like:

CAUTION: Be careful with the error management. Would be interesting to, instead of just failing, print a list of all scenarios errors or send a notification with all errors?


[#sizes]
== New Sizes

The *base-chart* have just the size *S* configured, it is time to include more sizes so we can adapt the deployment to the application performance requirements.

Find below a table with some sizes:

[cols="^,^,^", options="header"]

|request.cpu|50m
|request.memory|128Mi
